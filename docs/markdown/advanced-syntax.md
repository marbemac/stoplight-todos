# Stoplight Flavored Markdown (smd)

### The Two Laws

1.  smd is human readable. A human with a simple text editor can easily read and comprehend smd.
2.  smd degrades gracefully. An smd document rendered on `github.com` should be readable and clean.

### The Approach

1.  Stoplight flavored markdown extends github flavor markdown with inline comment annotations.
2.  The value inside of the annotations is a yaml object, and the annotation affects the following markdown block.

By leveraging comments to store annotations, Stoplight flavored markdown degrades gracefully to any other markdown renderer (Github, for example).

> [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) is an interesting project that might allow our users to add more interactivity to their docs, at the cost of complexity (this is a more advanced use case). We would have to figure out a way to introduce this WITHOUT impacting those users that do not need the feature.

## Tabs

A smd tab container is a `tab` annotation, followed by the tab content, and closed by a final `tab-end` annotation.

Tab containers cannot be nested.

<!--
type: tab
title: My First Tab
-->

**Here is one paragraph**

And another

-   one
-   two
    -   nested
    -   nested again

```js
const hello = 'world';
```

Fin.

<!--
type: tab
title: My Second Tab
-->

**Here is one paragraph**

And another

<!-- type: tab-end -->

#### Markdown Sample

```md
<!--
type: tab
title: My First Tab
-->

**Here is one paragraph**

And another

- one
- two
  - nested
  - nested again

<!--
type: tab
title: My Second Tab
-->

**Here is one paragraph**

And another

<!-- type: tab-end -->
```

## Callouts

A callout is a md block quote with an optional annotation that indicates intent.

<!-- theme: danger -->

> ### **Danger Will Robinson!**
>
> Here is my danger callout!

<!-- theme: warning -->

> ### **Watch Out!**
>
> Here is my warning callout!

<!-- theme: success -->

> ### **Mission Accomplished!**
>
> Here is my success callout!

<!-- theme: info -->

> ### **A thing to know**
>
> Here is my info callout

#### Markdown Sample

```md
<!-- theme: danger -->

> ### **Danger Will Robinson!**
>
> Here is my danger callout!

<!-- theme: warning -->

> ### **Watch Out!**
>
> Here is my warning callout!

<!-- theme: success -->

> ### **Mission Accomplished!**
>
> Here is my success callout!

<!-- theme: info -->

> ### **A thing to know**
>
> Here is my info callout
```

## Code Blocks

A smd code block is md code fence with an optional annotation to tweak the presentation of the code block.

<!--
title: "My code snippet"
lineNumbers: false
highlightLines: [[1,2], [4,5]]
-->

```javascript
var x = true;
```

## JSON Schema

A smd json schema block is a smd code block with the `json_schema` language tag. The contents of the code fence should
be the json schema object to be rendered.

<!-- type: json_schema -->

```json_schema
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"name": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	}
}
```

## HTTP Try It Out

A smd http try it out block is a smd code block with the `http` language tag. The contents of the code fence should
be the http object to be rendered.

<!-- type: http -->

```http
{
    "request": {
        "method": "get",
        "url": "https://next-api.stoplight.io/projects/45",
        "headers": {
            "content-type": "application/json"
        },
        "query": {
            "page": 2
        }
    }
}
```
